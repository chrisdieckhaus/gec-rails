            Female underrepresentation in engineering and STEM fields altogether present a threat
            to the livelihood to a challenge stricken generation. The gap in female engineering
            represents gender inequality in the United States sometimes as low nine percent in
            fields, such as in the petroleum engineering field. Across the spectrum of engineering,
            females make up only a quarter of the field’s professionals. The disparity of female
            engineers contributes to the shortage of engineers that this generation undoubtedly faces.
            With challenges such as climate change, global health, and energy sustainability, engineers are
            in high demand in the United States and the world.

           Universities filled with male-dominated science classrooms fail to offer sufficient support
           structures to inspire females as a minority to pursue an engineering major. Intimidation
           and social pressures against females cause an encouragement gap that Girls Engineering
           Change hopes to fill from a young age and throughout a girl’s time in college. Through
           early exposure and sustained mentorship, Girls Engineering Change hopes to provide a
           platform to get females interested in engineering and keep them interested through
           continuing sessions, mentorship, and leadership.

            Currently, the United States faces a shortage of engineers to address pressing
            world issues such as clean water, global health, and renewable energy. Girls Engineering
            Change hopes to eliminate this shortage by tapping into the female population and
            inspiring a new generation of engineers, an equitable and inspired generation. Even with
            the current graduation of engineers, some of the best graduates do not pursue careers in
            engineering. Girls Engineering Change hopes to inspire children at a young age to connect
            to the pressing issues of our generation and challenge them to make a difference in one
            session and throughout their lives.
